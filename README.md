# Spacing_Star

## Description 

Spacing Star is a space shooter game inspired by the classic "Asteroids," but with the addition of various enemy types beyond the classic asteroids. It features challenging controls and a dual-shooting system: an automatic cannon aimed with the mouse pointer and a powerful front-facing cannon. The game includes a dynamic difficulty system, a playable tutorial, and three progressive levels, culminating in a boss battle.
Throughout the game, you will face four types of enemies with unique behaviors and collect power-ups to enhance your ship's capabilities and survive in space.

A few years ago, I started working on this project. I wanted to dust it off and showcase what I was capable of while beginning my journey in game development. That being said, I don't believe it fully represents my current knowledge, but I plan to keep updating it over time to make it more reflective of my current skills.
